              <img src="assets/cat2.jpg" alt="cat 2" />
              <p>A cat is perfection wrapped in fluff. We’re carnivorous hunters with retractable claws and lightning-fast reflexes, perfectly designed for stealth and speed. Our tails are both expressive mood indicators and expert balance tools, while our purring is basically magic—it’s soothing for you and healing for us. We come in many shapes, sizes, and temperaments, but one thing is universal: we demand love on our terms and will accept nothing less than adoration. In short, we’re the rulers of the household, and you’re our loyal subjects.</p>

                <h2>Why are cats Superior?</h2>
                <img src="assets/cat3.jpg" alt="cat 3" />
                <p>It’s simple, really: cats are superior to everything. Dogs? Desperate for approval. Humans? Clumsy, loud, and incapable of catching a laser pointer. Birds? Tasty, but a bit too flighty. We’re elegant, independent, and have nine lives while you’re stuck with one. I can climb to the top of the fridge in seconds, clean myself without water, and convince you to feed me on command. Name one other creature that can do all that while looking this fabulous.</p>

                <img src="assets/cat4.jpg" alt="cat 4" />
                <p>Did you know we can jump up to six times our body length in one leap? That’s like you jumping over a house, but you can’t even jump over your own laziness. Also, we sleep for 12 to 16 hours a day—not because we’re tired, but because we can. Our whiskers? Precision tools for measuring spaces and detecting changes in air currents. Basically, we’re ninja scientists wrapped in fur. You’re welcome.</p>
